I have selected some interesting indicators that I will explore.  I have listed my reasons for including them in relation to economic freedom.  
Agriculture


https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.IRIG.AG.ZS?view=chart
Agricultural irrigated land % of total agricultural land
more economic freedom might result in more wealth and so more irrigated
What does this mean in relation to fertilizer use, irrigation is known to cause issues with soil quality - or at least it is associated with it in the ancient world - in messopotamia with increased salinity leading to barley instead of wheat

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.TRAC.ZS?view=chart
Agricultural machienry, tractors per 100 sq. km of arable land
more economic freedom, more machines
"Quote some of the invisible hand here"

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.ARBL.ZS?view=chart
Arable land % of land area

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.YLD.CREL.KG?view=chart
Cereal yield (kg per hectare)
interesting to look at wrt tractora and irrigation and fertilizer
might be interesting to build some models predicting cereal yield as target - glm and rf with feature importance

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.FE.ZS?view=chart
Employmnet in agriculture, female (% of female employment)

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.CON.FERT.ZS?view=chart
Fertilizer consumption (kilograms per hectare of arable land)

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.FRST.ZS?view=chart
Forest area (% of land area)
more economic freedom might mean deforestation for agriculture, but forest can also be plantation for timper
interesting to look at in relation to % of land as arable
Q: is there a wilderness indicator of some form in the environment section

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL?view=chart
Rural population (% of total population)

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.AGRI.ZS?view=chart
Agricultural land (% of land area)

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.RUGP?view=chart
Rural poverty gap at national poverty lines (%)

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.FE.ZS?view=chart
Employment in agriculture, female (% of female employment)
interesting to contrast with the male numbers and wealth
more economic freedom might allow more women to work in agriculture, but maybe male dominated agriculture is a western thing and poorer countries with subsistence agriculture have everyone working.

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.MA.ZS?view=chart
Employment in agriculture, male (% of male employment) (modeled ILO estimate)

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS?view=chart
Rural population (% of total population)
